# Gradient-Based Edge Detection and Enhancement in Images

Overview
This project implements a gradient-based edge detection system using Python. It provides various edge detection techniques including Sobel and Prewitt operators, with additional features like adaptive thresholding and edge enhancement.

Features:
-Multiple gradient operators (Sobel, Prewitt)
-Automatic threshold determination (Otsu and adaptive method)
-Gaussian noise reduction
-Edge enhancement capabilities
-Gradient magnitude and direction analysis
-Interactive visualization of results

Results Visualization:
The program generates four visualization panels:
-Original grayscaled image
-Gradient magnitude
-Gradient direction
-Enhanced edges
