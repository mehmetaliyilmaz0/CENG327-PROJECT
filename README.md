# CENG327-PROJECT

**Gradient-Based Edge Detection and Enhancement in Images**

## Overview

This project implements gradient-based techniques for edge detection and enhancement in digital images. The repository is designed for image processing enthusiasts, students, and researchers interested in computer vision and digital image analysis.

## Features

- Gradient-based edge detection algorithms
- Image enhancement functionalities
- Written in Python for ease of use and extensibility

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- Image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Pillow, or similarâ€”please update if specific packages are used)

## Project Structure

- `src/` or main code directory: Contains the core implementation files
- Scripts/notebooks: For running experiments or demonstrating features
- `README.md`: Project documentation

> **Note:** Please update this section with more specific details about the folder and file structure as necessary.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mehmetaliyilmaz0/CENG327-PROJECT.git
    cd CENG327-PROJECT
    ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your input images (recommended: place them in a designated folder such as `images/`).
2. Run the main script or notebook. Example:
    ```bash
    python main.py --input images/example.jpg --output results/processed.jpg
    ```
3. View output results in the specified output directory.

> **Note:** Please update usage instructions with the exact script names and options as appropriate for your implementation.

## Configuration

- Input and output directories can usually be specified via command-line arguments or config files.
- Additional parameters for edge detection and enhancement (e.g., threshold values, kernel size) may be configurable.

## Example

1. Original Image:

    ![Original](docs/original_image.jpg)

2. Edge Detection Output:

    ![Edge Detected](docs/edge_output.jpg)

> *(Add sample images to `docs/` folder and update the paths as needed.)*
